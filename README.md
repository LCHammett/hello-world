Hello, GitHub Community!

Lovely here. I am learning to develop and code. I hope to learn a lot so as to develop cool sites for myself and, in time, for others. I am working with HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and Wordpress for now. I am going to learn JavaScrip and JQuery and more and more as well.

Cheers,

Lovely
